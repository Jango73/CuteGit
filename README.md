# CuteGit

This is a simple UI for the GIT executable.
I decided to make my own because the only efficient GIT UIs on Linux are paywares.
It is however not meant to compete with paywares, just provide minimal GIT functionality.

## Building

Please do not use shadow build because of the submoduled qt-plus library.
