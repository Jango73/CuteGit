# CuteGit

![alt text](https://github.com/Jango73/CuteGit/blob/master/Media/Screenshot01.jpg)

This is a simple multi-document UI for the Git executable (and other versioning systems in a near future).
It is not meant to compete with paywares, just provide minimal versioning functionality.

## Dependencies

* Qt 5.13
* QtCreator 4.9.1
* qt-plus - Copyright myself
  * https://github.com/Jango73/qt-plus

## Building

* Make sure to update submodules

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
```
* Open /CuteGit.pro in QtCreator
* Build and run

## Things it does
